Need of File Handling
=====================
Value or data stored in variable is always temporary.
It remains in the variables so long as the program is running.
The moment program ends, memory of that variable is released and
value store in the variable lost.

If there is need to store data permanently which is received
in the variable, there is need of file.

Files are used to store data parmanently that can be retreived
afterward.
